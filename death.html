<h3> 1.Heart disease</h3>
<img class="img-circle" height="220px" width="220px" src="cd.jpg"><br>
Deaths: 614,348<br>

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the U.S. and also the leading cause of death worldwide. More than half of the deaths that occur as a result of heart disease are in men.

Heart disease is a term used to describe several conditions, many of which are related to plaque buildup in the walls of the arteries.

As the plaque builds up, the arteries narrow, this makes it more difficult for blood to flow and creates a risk for heart attack or stroke.

Other types of heart problems include angina, arrhythmias, and heart failure.

The key to preventing death from heart disease is to protect the heart and know the warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack.

Major warning signs and symptoms of heart attack

Some of the following signs and symptoms can materialize before a heart attack:
Chest pain or discomfort<br>
Pain or discomfort in the upper body, arms, neck, jaw, or upper stomach<br>
a. Breathlessness<br>
b. Nausea<br>
c. Lightheadedness<br>
d. Cold sweats<br>
<h3>Protecting the heart</h3>
 Lowering blood pressure and cholesterol can significantly lower heart disease risk. Several lifestyle and dietary modifications can dramatically reduce the risk of heart disease, including:<br>
a. Follow instructions to ensure safe use of medications and any OTC drugs<br>
b. Eating a diet that is low in salt, refined sugars, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol and high in fresh fruits and vegetables<br>
c. Exercise regularly (at least 150 minutes a week)<br>
d. Avoid excessive intake of alcohol<br>
e. Quit smoking<br>
f. Take steps to reduce stress levels, or get help with stress management</div><br></div>

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S.
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can interfere with essential life-sustaining systems and result in death.

Anyone can develop cancer, but the risk of most types of cancer increases with age, and some individuals have higher or lower risk due to differences in exposure to carcinogens (such as from smoking) and as a result of genetic factors.

Lung cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer in both men and women.<br><br>
Estimated cancer-related deaths for 2016
Leading causes of death from cancer for males:<br>

a. Lung and bronchus - 85,920<br>
b. Prostate - 26,120<br>
c. Colon and rectum - 26,020<br><br>
Leading causes of death from cancer for females:<br>

a. Lung and bronchus - 72,160<br>
b. Breast - 40,450<br>
c. Colon and rectum - 23,170<br>
<h3>Can cancer be prevented?</h3>
A substantial proportion of cancers are preventable, and all cancers caused by cigarette smoking and heavy use of alcohol could be prevented.

The World Cancer Research Fund has estimated that up to one-third of cancer cases that occur in economically developed countries like the U.S. are related to being overweight, obese, inactive (sedentary), or poor nutrition. These are all preventable.

Some cancers are related to infectious agents such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) - these may be prevented through behavioral changes and use of protective vaccinations and antibiotic treatments.

Many of the more than 3 million skin  cases that are diagnosed annually could be prevented by protecting skin from excessive sun exposure and avoiding indoor tanning.</div>
